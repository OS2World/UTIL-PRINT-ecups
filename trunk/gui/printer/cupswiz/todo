- Check to make sure CUPS.PDR is installed, and (offer to) install if missing.
- Ditto for gzip.exe, rinstprn.exe and cupsport.exe
- Offer the option to show both simplified/expert drivers.
- Allow setting at least some basic job options like paper/colour/quality.
- I18N support
- Is there a way to generate the PPD for driver import when using exe://?  e.g.
  get the saved PPD from the cups\etc\cups\ppd directory.
